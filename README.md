## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: SvelteKit, Tailwind CSS v4, Motion One, TypeScript
- **Backend**: Appwrite (Functions, Storage, Database), Cloudflare Workers
- **Image Processing**: Sharp (WebP preview generation)
- **Dev Tools**: pnpm, Cloudflare (for deployment)
- **Services**: Image interrogator hosted on fartcore's server

## Development Status

This project is under active development with frequent additions and refactors. All current infrastructure is functioning, and visual/UX polish is ongoing.

## Setup

To run the project locally:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Ensure `.env` contains required private keys for Appwrite.

## Customization

### Image Scrolling Speed

The homepage features a film-roll effect with scrolling image columns. You can customize the scrolling speed:

- **Location**: In `/src/routes/+page.svelte` inside the column generation loop
- **Current Setting**:
  ```svelte
  {@const animationDuration = 80 + (colIndex % 5) * 10}
  ```

#### How to adjust:

- **Lower values** = faster scrolling
- **Higher values** = slower scrolling

#### Customization options:

1. **Simple adjustment**: Modify the base duration (80) and variation (10):

   ```svelte
   // Faster scrolling
   {@const animationDuration = 30 + (colIndex % 5) * 5}

   // Slower scrolling
   {@const animationDuration = 120 + (colIndex % 5) * 15}
   ```

2. **Advanced customization**: Add reactive variables to the script section:

   ```svelte
   // Add to script section let baseScrollSpeed = $state(80); // Base animation duration in seconds
   let scrollVariation = $state(10); // Amount of variation between columns // Then in your template
   {@const animationDuration = baseScrollSpeed + (colIndex % 5) * scrollVariation}
   ```

This allows easy speed adjustments from a central location and could be extended with UI controls.
